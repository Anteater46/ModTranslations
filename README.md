# Anteater46's Mod Translations
This is the repository for translations to Anteater46's mods.

All translators are greatly appreciated and given credit in the 'mods' page when the client loads, as well as on the project page of the mod.

#### With all my mods, you can look at the issues to see if any translations are out of date.

## Flour Power
To get started translating Flour Power, download the 'en_US.json' file and use it as a template for your translations.
